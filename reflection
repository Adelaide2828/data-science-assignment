After developing and comparing two recommendation approaches for a movie dataset: collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, I have disovered that both methods have merits in this regard, but Content-Based Filtering proved more effective for this specific implementation. The content-based approach demonstrated superior performance because it directly leverages movie attributes such as 'movie genre' that are consistently available. It provides transparent recommendations based on measurable features and it worked reliably even with limited user data. 

The challenges I have faced while doing the assignmnet was that Content Based Filtering does not work well with duplicates. Furthermore,it was difficult to provide recommendations for new users without rating history when using the Collaborative method.
